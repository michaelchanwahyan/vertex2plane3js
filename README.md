## vertex2plane3js
### note

In computer graphics a plane may be defined by the vertices that define its boundaries.
This project attemps to retrieve the plane parameters that characterise the plane defined by input vertices.

The plane parameters are
- width
- height
- x axis offset
- y axis offset
- z axis offset
- rotational offset along x axis
- rotational offset along y axis
- rotational offset along z axis

it worths mention that this project is for three.js integration use and is not intended to be a standalone work.
this is just an intermediate snapshot on what i'm doing lately.
